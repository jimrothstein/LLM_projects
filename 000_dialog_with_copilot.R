# Copilot:  Briefly, what is an ellipse?  Do not write R code, just explain.
# An ellipse is a geometric shape that resembles a flattened circle. It is defined as the set of all points in a plane such that the sum of the distances from two fixed points (called foci) is constant. Ellipses have two axes: the major axis (the longest diameter) and the minor axis (the shortest diameter). They are commonly found in various fields such as astronomy,
  # copilot, please write the equation for an ellipse center at origin
    # The equation for an ellipse centered at the origin (0,0) is given by:
